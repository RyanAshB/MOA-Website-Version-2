                <h2>Yellow Yam</h2>
                <hr>
                <h6>Production</h6>
                <p>Yellow yam is the most produced yam variety in Jamaica, averaging 75% of total yam production annually from 2015-2021 (MOAF). It is cultivated islandwide, however, Trelawny and St. Ann are the major producers. Trelawny is Jamaica’s third largest supplier of domestic agricultural production with 9,956 registered farmers. Eighty per cent (80%) of agricultural production in Trelawny consists of yams, sold both domestically and internationally in large volumes, fuelling Jamaica’s global export dominance with an ownership of 22.2% of the export market (FAOSTAT, 2021) .</p>
                
                <h6>Consumption</h6>
                <p>The local consumption of yam from 2015—2021 has continuously been significantly greater than the exportation of the crop. Since 2017 there has been a continuous increase in both the exportation of yam and in its production (See Table 1).</p>

                <h6>Local Market</h6>
                <p>In addition to local turmeric production, 1.6 billion kg (valuing J$CIF 500 million) was imported during 2016-2021. This represents an opportunity for import substitution. There is a sizeable need for facilities which are able to dry and convert the turmeric into a powdered form, allowing easier use. The table below represents the quantity and value of imports.</p>

                <hr>
                <h6>Benefits of Goat Milk Consumption:</h6>
                <ul>
                    <li>Higher nutritional content than cow’s milk</li>
                    <li>Source of minerals for daily consumption by humans</li>

                <h6>Cost of live dairy goats</h6>
                <p>Average cost of a mature ram ranges between $90,000 to $120,000 and doe from $60,000 to $80,000. Graded goat (mix of Boer and Nubian) are more affordable.</p>

                <h6>Initial investment</h6>
                <p>A typical housing unit for 100 heads of goats is expected to cost $5,757,405,95 for chevron production (AIC, 2019). It is expected to cost a similar amount for a dairy goat house; but more partitions are needed to separate kids from mothers to promote increased milk production.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>As Gross Domestic Product per capita increases, the demand for superior protein such as goat’s milk also increases at premium prices.</li>
                    <li>The amount of feed required for a cow can be used to feed 10 goats which collectively will yield twice as much milk per day.</li>
                    <li>Start of mobile milking of graded goats on meat-producing farms</li>
                    <li>Thriving domestic market with low level of local supplies.</li>
